WDIR Unit 1's project - Family Feud 

My project consists mostly of Jquery, Javascript, and CSS. I used objects, arrays, functions, callbacks, randomizing, DOM manipulation, and CSS animations.

I originally built it as a single player experience. I used variables set to an array containing all the challenge questions and answers, then used strings built from that to display in the appropriate places throughout the game. Eventually, a second player was added, after making sure the single player model worked flawlessly. Now, the game can be won either by earning a certain amount of money, or by default when the other player loses all their money.

Unsolved problems include non-optimization of code. I wanted to separate my js code across multiple files for readability purposes, but when I tried it, I immediately ran into code breaking issues. I know it can be done, but we haven't learned that part yet. And since it wasn't technically necessary, I skipped it in order to focus on more functional improvements.
